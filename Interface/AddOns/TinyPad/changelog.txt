v3.0.2, 7/26/20
- Fix for page not saving if it's up on screen during a logout/reload.
v3.0.1, 7/5/20, Complete rewrite. Changes include:
- When the mouse is off the window while it doesn't have focus, the toolbar, bordering frame, etc. will fade away and leave only the text area on screen.
- When there's not enough text on a page to scroll, the scrollbar will now hide and allow text to wrap across width ordinarily taken up by the scrollbar.
- The toolbar now adapts to the size of the window. For instance: as you narrow the window's width, the page number will collapse; narrowing it even further will make the toolbar buttons smaller; and narrowing it even more will make the undo/redo buttons collapse.
- The pop-out bar for search and settings now appears inside the window instead of outside the window.
- The bookmark list is now a scrollable panel that appears inside the window rather than a context menu outside the window.
- Confirmation dialogs now appear inside the window as well, rather than static popup dialogs in the center of the screen.
- Undo/Redo buttons (or Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) can revert and restore incremental changes to a page.
- The font button will now summon a bar to choose a Serif (Fritz Quad Bold), San Serif (Arial) or Monospace (Inconsolata) font in Small, Medium or Large sizes. (Those who previously edited the Lua to choose your own fonts, that's now in panels\fontbar.lua.)
- Bookmarked pages now have their title displayed on the main window.
- The transparency option will now only make the text area semi-transparent, since the remainder of the window fades completely when it loses focus.
- Mousewheel over the scrollbar will scroll the content.
- While locked, the window can now be moved by holding Shift as you drag the window with the mouse.
- When the Find button or Enter key is hit in the search box (with text to search), the border of the editbox will flash green if it found a hit and red if not.
- An optional minimap button for summoning and dismissing TinyPad can be turned on from the Minimap button in the settings toolbar.
- Button textures are all updated for a higher resolution and better scaling.
- The relatively new retail client behavior of clicking elsewhere to lose focus on an editbox is now supported in search and bookmark title editboxes.
- The same version works on both Retail and Classic clients; though Classic clients will need to load out of date addons.
